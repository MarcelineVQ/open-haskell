Hi everyone,

A few things XXX

**Getting set up with Haskell**.  In case you haven't already figured
  it out, the course website
  [has a list of resources](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/resources.html)
  and instructions to help you get set up installing the Haskell
  Platform, picking an editor, and so on.  If you have any trouble
  don't hesitate to
  [ask a question on Piazza](https://piazza.com/class#spring2013/cis194)
  or come to office hours (see below).

**HW 1**.  You can find your first assignment, as well as notes from
  Monday's lecture, by going to the
  [course website](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/) and clicking
  [Lectures & Assignments](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/lectures.html).
  
  To turn in HW 1, XXX
  
**Office hours**.  Tomorrow (1/18) I will hold office hours from
  2:30-4:30.  In the future I will hold office hours every Friday from
  2-4pm.

**MLK Day**.  There will not be class this Monday, January 21, in
  observance of MLK Day (check out the
  [Greater Philadelphia MLK Day of Service website](http://www.mlkdayofservice.org/)
  for service opportunities).  However, it would be super lame to wait
  *two whole weeks* to learn more Haskell!  Therefore, **new lecture
  notes and a new homework assignment** have been posted on the course
  website. You are expected to read through the lecture notes and
  complete the homework assignment, due Monday, January 28.
