\textbf{What to turn in}: you should turn a single |.hs| (or |.lhs|)
file, which \textbf{must type check}.


\exerciset{Wholemeal programming}

Reimplement each of the following functions in a more idiomatic
Haskell style.  Use \emph{wholemeal programming} practices, breaking
each function into a pipeline of incremental transformations to an
entire data structure.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
\begin{code}
fun1 :: [Integer] -> Integer
fun1 []     = 1
fun1 (x:xs)
  | even x    = (x - 2) * fun1 xs
  | otherwise = fun1 xs
\end{code}

\item
\begin{code}
fun2 :: Integer -> Integer
fun2 1 = 0
fun2 n | even n    = n + fun2 (n `div` 2)
       | otherwise = fun2 (3 * n + 1)
\end{code}

Name your functions |fun1'| and |fun2'| respectively.

Hint: For this problem you may wish to use the functions |iterate| and
|takeWhile|.  Look them up in the Prelude documentation to see what
they do.
\end{enumerate}


\exerciset{Folding with trees}

Recall the definition of a
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree} {binary tree data
  structure}. The \term{height} of a binary tree is the length of a
path from the root to the deepest node.  For example, the height of a
tree with a single node is $0$; the height of a tree with three nodes,
whose root has two children, is $1$; and so on.  A binary tree is
\term{balanced} if the height of its left and right subtrees differ by
no more than $1$, and its left and right subtrees are also
balanced.

You should use the following data structure to represent binary trees,
provided in |Tree.hs|.  Note that each node stores an extra |Integer|
representing the height at that node.

\begin{code}
data Tree a = Leaf
            | Node Integer (Tree a) a (Tree a)
  deriving (Show, Eq)
\end{code}

For this exercise, write a function
\begin{spec}
foldTree :: [a] -> Tree a
foldTree = ...
\end{spec}
which generates a balanced binary tree from a list of values using
|foldr|.

For example, one sample output would be the following:

\begin{code}
foldTree [1..10] ==
  Node 3
    (Node 2
      (Node 0 Leaf 6 Leaf) 9
      (Node 1 (Node 0 Leaf 2 Leaf) 3 Leaf))
    10
    (Node 2
      (Node 1 (Node 0 Leaf 1 Leaf) 7 Leaf)
      8
      (Node 1 (Node 0 Leaf 4 Leaf) 5 Leaf))
\end{code}

\begin{code}
      10
   /      \
  9        8
 / \      / \
6   3    7   5
   /    /   /
  2    1   4
\end{code}

Your solution might not place the nodes in the same exact order, but it should
be balanced and each subtree should have a correct computed height.

\exerciset{More folds!}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement a function
\begin{code}
xor :: [Bool] -> Bool
\end{code}
which returns |True| if and only if there are an odd number of |True|
values contained in the input list.  It does not matter how many
|False| values the input list contains.  For example,

|xor [False, True, False] == True|

|xor [False, True, False, False, True] == False|

Your solution must be implemented using a fold.

\item Implement |map| as a fold.  That is, complete the definition

\begin{code}
map' :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map' f = foldr ...
\end{code}

  in such a way that |map'| behaves identically to the standard |map|
  function.

\item Implement |foldl| using |foldr|. That is, complete the definition

\begin{code}
myFoldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
myFoldl f base xs = foldr ...
\end{code}

  in such a way that |myFoldl| behaves identically to the standard |foldl|
  function.

  Hint: Study how the application of |foldr| and |foldl| work out:
\begin{code}
foldr f z [x1, x2, ..., xn] == x1 `f` (x2 `f` ... (xn `f` z)...)
foldl f z [x1, x2, ..., xn] == (...((z `f` x1) `f` x2) `f`...) `f` xn
\end{code}

\end{enumerate}

\exerciset{Finding primes}

Read about the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Sundaram}
{Sieve of Sundaram}. Implement the algorithm using function composition.
Given an integer |n|, your function should generate all the prime numbers up to
|2n + 2|.

To give you some help, we've provided a function to get the cartesian
product of two lists. This is similar to `zip`, but it produces all possible
pairs instead of matching up the list elements. It's written using list
comprehensions, which we haven't gotten to yet (but feel free to research them).

\begin{code}
cartProd :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
cartProd xs ys = [(x,y) | x <- xs, y <- ys]

sieveSundaram :: Integer -> [Integer]
sieveSundaram = ...
\end{code}
