\textbf{What to turn in}: you should turn a single |.hs| (or |.lhs|)
file, which \textbf{must type check}.


\exerciset{Wholemeal programming}

Reimplement each of the following functions in a more idiomatic
Haskell style.  Use \emph{wholemeal programming} practices, breaking
each function into a sequence of incremental transformations of an
entire data structure.

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\begin{code}
fun1 :: [Integer] -> Integer
fun1 []     = 1
fun1 (x:xs)
  | even x    = (x - 2) * fun1 xs
  | otherwise = fun1 xs
\end{code}

\item
\begin{code}
fun2 :: Integer -> Integer
fun2 1 = 0
fun2 n | even n    = n + fun2 (n `div` 2)
       | otherwise = fun2 (3 * n + 1)
\end{code}

Name your functions |fun1'| and |fun2'| respectively.

Hint: For this problem you may wish to use the functions |iterate| and
|takeWhile|.  Look them up in the Prelude documentation to see what
they do.
\end{enumerate}


\exerciset{Folding with trees}

Recall the definition of a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree}
{binary tree data structure}. A branch of a binary tree is balanced if the
height of its left and right children differ by no more than 1 (height at a
node is the number of nodes you must traverse to reach the deepest leaf).
Write a function that generates a balanced binary tree from a list of values
using |foldr|.

Assume the data exists in the branches (nodes), as described in the following
data structure. Note that we keep track of the height of a subtree at each
node as an |Integer|:

\begin{code}
data Tree a = Leaf
            | Branch Integer (Tree a) a (Tree a)
  deriving (Show, Eq)

foldTree :: [a] -> Tree a
foldTree = ...
\end{code}

For example, one sample output would be the following:

\begin{code}
foldTree [1..10] ==
  Branch 3
    (Branch 2
      (Branch 0 Leaf 6 Leaf) 9
      (Branch 1 (Branch 0 Leaf 2 Leaf) 3 Leaf))
    10
    (Branch 2
      (Branch 1 (Branch 0 Leaf 1 Leaf) 7 Leaf)
      8
      (Branch 1 (Branch 0 Leaf 4 Leaf) 5 Leaf))

Visually, the tree looks like this:
      10
   /      \
  9        8
 / \      / \
6   3    7   5
   /    /   /
  2    1   4

\end{code}

Your solution might not place the nodes in the same exact order, but it should
be balanced and each subtree should have a correct computed height.

\exerciset{More folds!}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement a function
\begin{code}
xor :: [Bool] -> Bool
\end{code}
which returns |True| if and only if there are an odd number of |True|
values contained in the input list.  It does not matter how many
|False| values the input list contains.  For example,

|xor [False, True, False] == True|

|xor [False, True, False, False, True] == False|

Your solution must be implemented using a fold.

\item Implement |map| as a fold.  That is, complete the definition

\begin{code}
map' :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map' f = foldr ...
\end{code}

  in such a way that |map'| behaves identically to the standard |map|
  function.

\item Implement |foldl| using |foldr|. That is, complete the definition

\begin{code}
myFoldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
myFoldl f base xs = foldr ...
\end{code}

  in such a way that |myFoldl| behaves identically to the standard |foldl|
  function.

  Hint: Study how the application of |foldr| and |foldl| work out:
\begin{code}
foldr f z [x1, x2, ..., xn] == x1 `f` (x2 `f` ... (xn `f` z)...)
foldl f z [x1, x2, ..., xn] == (...((z `f` x1) `f` x2) `f`...) `f` xn
\end{code}

\end{enumerate}

\exerciseset{Finding primes}

Read about the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Sundaram}
{Sieve of Sundaram}. Implement the algorithm using function composition.
Given an integer |n|, your function should generate all the prime numbers up to
|2n + 2|.

To give you some help, we've provided a function to get the cartesian
product of two lists. This is similar to `zip`, but it produces all possible
pairs instead of matching up the list elements. It's written using list
comprehensions, which we haven't gotten to yet (but feel free to research them).

\begin{code}
cartProd :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
cartProd xs ys = [(x,y) | x <- xs, y <- ys]

sieveSundaram :: Integer -> [Integer]
sieveSundaram = ...
\end{code}
