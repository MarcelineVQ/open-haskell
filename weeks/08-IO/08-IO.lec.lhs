First, finishing up a few things from last week:

Type synonyms and newtypes
--------------------------

Suppose we have a type `T` and we want to make another type which is
"the same as" `T`.  We have two options.

**Type synonyms**

The first option is to make a *type synonym*, introduced with the
`type` keyword:

~~~~ {.haskell}
type S = T
~~~~

This creates `S` as a type synonym for `T`.  `S` is simply a
*different name* for `T`, so they can be used interchangeably.

When would we want to do this?

* As abbreviation: `T` is long and frequently used, so we want to give
  it a shorter name `S` in order to save us some typing (and make type
  signatures easier to read).
* As documentation: for example, suppose a function takes three
  `String`s, where the first two represent names and the third
  represents a message.  We could write

    > type Name = String
    > type Message = String
    >
    > f :: Name -> Name -> Message -> Int

    This way it would be more obvious to someone reading the type of `f`
    what arguments it expects, but they can still pass `String` values
    to `f` as before.

**Newtypes**

The other option is to create a `newtype`, like this:

~~~~ {.haskell}
newtype N = C T
~~~~

The idea is that this creates a "new type" `N` which is *isomorphic* to
`T` but is a separate type---unlike with type synonyms, the compiler
will complain if we mix them up.  We cannot pass a value of type `T`
as an argument when an `N` is expected, or vice versa.  In order to
convert between them we need to use the constructor `C`---either
applying it (to convert from `T` to `N`) or pattern-matching on it (to
convert from `N` to `T`).

This has several common uses:

  1. To get the compiler's help distinguishing between types we do not
     want to mix up.  For example, if we have two types, one for
     representing meters and one for representing feet, we probably
     want to represent them as

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
    newtype Meters = Meters Double
    newtype Feet   = Feet Double
    ~~~~

	 This way, if we accidentally use a value in meters where we meant
	 to use one in feet, we will get a compiler error instead of
	 having our $125 million Mars probe crash.

  1. As we saw last week, if we want to give multiple type class
     instances to the same type, we can instead wrap the type in several
     different `newtype`s and give an instance for each.

So why use `newtype` instead of just

~~~~ {.haskell}
data N = C T
~~~~

? There are several ways in which `newtype` differs from `data`:

  1. `newtype`s may only have a single constructor with a single
     argument.  This may seem like an annoying restriction, but the point
     is that...

  1. `newtype`s have *no run-time cost*.  That is, at run-time, values
     of the types `N` and `T` will be represented *identically* in
     memory.  If we had instead written `data N = C T` values of type
     `N` would be paired with a "tag" to indicate the constructor `C`.
     Since `newtype`s can only have a single constructor with a single
     value inside it, there is no need to actually store the
     constructor.

  1. GHC has an extension called `GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving` which
     allows one to automatically derive type class instances for a
     `newtype` based on instances for the underlying type.  For
     example, instead of writing

	~~~~ {.haskell}
    newtype Moo = Moo Int

    instance Num Moo where
      (Moo x) + (Moo y) = Moo (x + y)
      (Moo x) * (Moo y) = Moo (x * y)
      abs (Moo x)       = Moo (abs x)
      ...
    ~~~~

    we can just write

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
    {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}

    newtype Moo = Moo Int
      deriving (Num)
    ~~~~

Record syntax
-------------

Suppose we have a data type such as

~~~~ {.haskell}
data D = C T1 T2 T3
~~~~

We could also declare this data type with *record syntax* as follows:

~~~~ {.haskell}
data D = C { field1 :: T1, field2 :: T2, field3 :: T3 }
~~~~

where we specify not just a type but also a *name* for each field
stored inside the `C` constructor.  This new version of `D` can be
used in all the same ways as the old version (in particular we can
still construct and pattern-match on values of type `D` as `C v1 v2
v3`).  However, we get some additional benefits.

  1. Each field name is automatically a *projection function* which
     gets the value of that field out of a value of type `D`.  For
     example, `field2` is a function of type

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
	field2 :: D -> T2
	~~~~

     Before, we would have had to implement `field2` ourselves by
     writing

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
	field2 (C _ f _) = f
	~~~~

	 This gets rid of a lot of boilerplate if we have a data type with
	 many fields!

  1. There is special syntax for *constructing*, *modifying*, and
     *pattern-matching* on values of type `D` (in addition to the
     usual syntax for such things).

	 We can *construct* a value of type `D` using syntax like

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
    C { field3 = ..., field1 = ..., field2 = ... }
    ~~~~

     with the `...` filled in by expressions of the right type.  Note
     that we can specify the fields in any order.

     Suppose we have a value `d :: D`.  We can *modify* `d` using
     syntax like

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
    d { field3 = ... }
    ~~~~

     Of course, by "modify" we don't mean actually mutating `d`, but
     rather constructing a new value of type `D` which is the same as
     `d` except with the `field3` field replaced by the given value.

     Finally, we can *pattern-match* on values of type `D` like so:

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
    foo (C { field1 = x }) = ... x ...
    ~~~~

     This matches only on the `field1` field from the `D` value,
     calling it `x` (of course, in place of `x` we could also put an
     arbitrary pattern), ignoring the other fields.

Record syntax is often used for `newtype`s, for example:

> newtype Foo = Foo { unFoo :: Int }

Now we can convert between `Int` and `Foo` using

~~~~ {.haskell}
Foo   :: Int -> Foo
unFoo :: Foo -> Int
~~~~

Now, onwards to `IO`!

-->

The problem with purity
-----------------------

Remember that Haskell is *lazy* and therefore *pure*.  This means two
primary things:

1. Functions may not have any external effects. For example, a
   function may not print anything on the screen.  Functions may
   only compute their outputs.
   
2. Functions may not depend on external stuff.  For example, they may
   not read from the keyboard, or filesystem, or network.  Functions
   may depend only on their inputs---put another way, functions should
   give the same output for the same input every time.

But---sometimes we *do* want to be able to do stuff like this!  If the
only thing we could do with Haskell is write functions which we can
then evaluate at the ghci prompt, it would be theoretically
interesting but practically useless.

In fact, it *is* possible to do these sorts of things with Haskell,
but it looks very different than in most other languages.

The `IO` type
-------------

The solution to the conundrum is a special type called `IO`.  Values
of type `IO a` are *descriptions of* effectful computations, which, if
executed would (possibly) perform some effectful I/O operations and
(eventually) produce a value of type `a`.  There is a level of
indirection here that's crucial to understand.  A value of type `IO
a`, *in and of itself*, is just an inert, perfectly safe thing with no
effects. It is just a *description* of an effectful computation.  One
way to think of it is as a *first-class imperative program*.

As an illustration, suppose you have

    c :: Cake

What do you have?  Why, a delicious cake, of course.  Plain and
simple.

<img src="/static/cake.jpg" width="200" />

By contrast, suppose you have

    r :: Recipe Cake

What do you have?  A cake?  No, you have some *instructions* for how
to make a cake, just a sheet of paper with some writing on it.  

<img src="/static/recipe.gif" width="200" />

Not only do you not actually have a cake, merely being in possession
of the recipe has no effect on anything else whatsoever.  Simply
holding the recipe in your hand does not cause your oven to get hot or
flour to be spilled all over your floor or anything of that sort.  To
actually produce a cake, the recipe must be *followed* (causing flour
to be spilled, ingredients mixed, the oven to get hot, *etc.*).

<img src="/static/fire.jpg" width="200" />

In the same way, a value of type `IO a` is just a "recipe" for
producing a value of type `a` (and possibly having some effects along
the way).  Like any other value, it can be passed as an argument,
returned as the output of a function, stored in a data structure, or
(as we will see shortly) combined with other `IO` values into more
complex recipes.

So, how do values of type `IO a` actually ever get executed?  There is
only one way: the Haskell compiler looks for a special value

    main :: IO ()

which will actually get handed to the runtime system and
executed. That's it! Think of the Haskell runtime system as a master
chef who is the only one allowed to do any cooking.

<img src="/static/chef.jpg" width="200" />

If you want your recipe to be followed then you had better make it
part of the big recipe (`main`) that gets handed to the master chef.
Of course, `main` can be arbitrarily complicated, and will usually be
composed of many smaller `IO` computations.

So let's write our first actual, executable Haskell program!  We can
use the function

    putStrLn :: String -> IO ()

which, given a `String`, returns an `IO` computation that will (when
executed) print out that `String` on the screen.  So we simply put
this in a file called `Hello.hs`:

    main = putStrLn "Hello, Haskell!"

Then typing `runhaskell Hello.hs` at a command-line prompt results in
our message getting printed to the screen!  We can also use `ghc
--make Hello.hs` to produce an executable version called `Hello` (or
`Hello.exe` on Windows).

There is no `String` "inside" an `IO String`
--------------------------------------------

Many new Haskell users end up at some point asking a question like "I
have an `IO String`, how do I turn it into a `String`?", or, "How do I
get the `String` out of an `IO String`"?  Given the above intuition,
it should be clear that these are nonsensical questions: a value of
type `IO String` is a description of some computation, a *recipe*, for
generating a `String`.  There is no `String` "inside" an `IO String`,
any more than there is chicken "inside" a chicken recipe.  To produce a
`String` (or some delicious chicken) requires actually *executing* the
computation (or recipe).  And the only way to do that is to give it
(perhaps as part of some larger `IO` value) to the Haskell runtime
system, via `main`.

Combining `IO`
--------------

As should be clear by now, we need a way to *combine* `IO`
computations into larger ones.

The simplest way to combine two `IO` computations is with the `(>>)`
operator (pronounced "and then"), which has the type

~~~~ {.haskell}
(>>) :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b
~~~~

This simply creates an `IO` computation which consists of running the
two input computations in sequence.  Notice that the result of the
first computation is discarded; we only care about it for its
*effects*.  For example:

~~~~ {.haskell}
main = putStrLn "Hello" >> putStrLn "world!"
~~~~

This works fine for code of the form "do this; do this; do this" where
the results don't really matter. However, in general this is
insufficient.  What if we don't want to throw away the result from the
first computation?
  
A first attempt at resolving the situation might be to have something
of type `IO a -> IO b -> IO (a,b)`.  However, this is also
insufficient. The reason is that we want the second computation to be
able to *depend* on the result of the first.  For example, suppose we
want to read an integer from the user and then print out one more than
the integer they entered.  In this case the second computation
(printing some number on the screen) will be different depending on
the result of the first.
  
Instead, there is an operator `(>>=)` (pronounced "bind") with the
type

~~~~ {.haskell}
(>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b
~~~~

This can be difficult to wrap one's head around at first!  `(>>=)`
takes a computation which will produce a value of type `a`, and a
*function* which gets to *compute* a second computation based on this
intermediate value of type `a`.  The result of `(>>=)` is a
(description of a) computation which performs the first computation,
uses its result to decide what to do next, and then does that.

For example, we can write a program to read a number from the user and
print out its successor.  Note our use of `readLn :: Read a => IO a`
which is a computation that reads input from the user and converts it
into any type which is an instance of `Read`.

~~~~ {.haskell}
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Please enter a number: " >> (readLn >>= (\n -> putStrLn (show (n+1))))
~~~~

Of course, this looks kind of ugly, but there are better ways to write it, which
we'll talk about in the future.
